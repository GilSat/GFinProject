        "\n",
        "Male infertility is a reproductive disease that makes it so men are unable to procreate and have children. \n",
        "\n",
        "Male fertility is becoming an increasing problem. 1 in 7 couples are infertile so we will use a study in the form of a dataset to see if there are any risk factors associated with infertile males.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Research Question and Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we will attempt to see if we can see the risk factors associated with male infertility. The main question we are trying to answer is if we can expect a correlation with those factors and infertility \n",
        "\n",
        "We will download the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Fertility# and convert it into a CSV file. We will then analyze the data in colab/juypter \n",
        "\n",
        "##Approach \n",
        "\n",
        "We will then analyze the data in colab using EDA methods. We will find relationships with variables, do regressions, and show charts to find the answer to our question.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to sift out the information using regressions and charts to find the the trends in the data that show an answer to the question we are trying to answer."
